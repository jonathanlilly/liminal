# Liminal

Liminal is a theme for scientific presentations using [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) together with [KaTeX](https://katex.org), available for [download](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/liminal/archive/master.zip) from Github.

In addition to the features of Remark.js, Liminal includes: 

*  A particular choice of slide layout and styling
*  A subtle fade in/out transition between slides        
*  Markup for a title slide, for footnotes, and for references     
*  A compass at the bottom left that links to a table of contents        
*  Markup for a two-column format        
*  Perhaps most importantly, portable equations using KaTeX
*  A directory structure to keep things organized
