# Liminal

Liminal is a theme for scientific presentations using [Remark.js][1] together with [KaTeX][2], available for [download][3] from Github.

In addition to the features of Remark.js, Liminal includes: 

*  A particular choice of slide layout and styling
*  A subtle fade in/out transition between slides        
*  Markup for a title slide, for footnotes, and for citations   
*  A compass at the bottom left that links to a table of contents        
*  Markup for a two-column format        
*  Perhaps most importantly, portable equations using KaTeX
*  A directory structure to keep things organized

See [liminal/index.html][4] for full details within a sample presentation.
